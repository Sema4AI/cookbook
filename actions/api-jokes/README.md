# Use API to get random joke, or jokes about a theme

This simple example shows how to make API calls with Actions. It contains two actions:

1. generate a single random joke 
2. generate jokes based on a given theme.

Credit for this example goes to [Francesco](https://github.com/FrancescoSaverioZuppichini/chatgpt-action-fastapi), who posted the similiar example made with FastAPI and Vercel. We wanted to show how much easier Action Server is.
