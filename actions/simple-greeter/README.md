# Greeter example

This shows the very basic python action in action :D

To run this use `action-server start`.

You may then check http://localhost:8080 for the Action Server UI.
There you can try the action `greet` out.

You can expose this action to internet with `action-server start --expose`.
Then you may use it in services such as OpenAI GPT Action.
