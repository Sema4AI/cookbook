# Agent Context Action Package

This package provides a temporary solution for accessing the Sema4.ai Agent invocation context within Studio and Work Room chat executions.

> **Note:**
> This approach is intended as an interim solution and will be superseded by official support in Sema4.ai in the near future. Ongoing maintenance for this package is not planned.
